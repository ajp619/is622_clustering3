For our clustering experiments, we will be using the Birch3 dataset from http://cs.joensuu.fi/sipu/datasets/. This is a simple 2-D dataset of 100000 observations and 100 clusters. This simple dataset will allow us to concentrate on the algorithms and give us an easy way to visualize the results. As a baseline, we can use the builtin kmeans.

```{r}
birch3 <- read.table("birch3.txt")
km <- kmeans(birch3, 100)

plot(birch3)
points(km$centers, pch=19, col="red")
```

We can see from the above plot that there is some room for improvement.

Let's start with Hadoop.
