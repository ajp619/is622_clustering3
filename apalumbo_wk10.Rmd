## 7.6.1 (Section 7.6.7)

Execute the BDMO Algorightm with $p = 3$ on the following 1-dimensional, Euclidean data:

$$1, 45, 80, 24, 56, 71, 17, 40, 66, 32, 48, 96, 9, 41, 75, 11, 58, 93, 28, 39, 77$$

The clustering algorithms is *k*-means with $k = 3$. Only the centroid of a cluster, along with its count, is needed to represent a cluster.

```{r}
x <- c( 1, 45, 80, 
       24, 56, 71, 17, 40, 66, 
       32, 48, 96,  9, 41, 75, 11, 58, 93, 28, 39, 77)

p <- 3
